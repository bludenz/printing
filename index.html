            <h2>How to Find Models & Place an Order</h2>
            <div class="guide-content">
                <h3>Step 1: Finding Your Model</h3>
                <p>You can find pre-designed 3D models on various online repositories. Some popular sites include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Thingiverse:** A vast library of free, user-created designs.</li>
                    <li>**Printables:** Another excellent resource with a focus on printable designs and contests.</li>
                    <li>**MyMiniFactory:** Curated selection of high-quality 3D printable files.</li>
                    <li>**Cults 3D:** Features both free and paid designs, often for more niche or detailed models.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When searching, look for models in common 3D printing file formats like **.STL** or **.OBJ**. Make sure the model is suitable for 3D printing and note its approximate dimensions if possible.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Placing Your Order</h3>
                <p>Once you have your model (or a clear idea of what you want designed), placing an order with us is simple:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>**Contact Us:** Send an email to [Your Business Email Address] with your request.</li>
                    <li>**Attach Your Model:** If you have a file, attach it. If you need a custom design, describe your idea in detail.</li>
                    <li>**Specify Requirements:** Let us know your preferred filament type and color (refer to our list above), and any specific dimensions or strength requirements.</li>
                    <li>**Receive Your Quote:** We'll review your request and provide a detailed quote including material cost, print time, and any design fees.</li>
                    <li>**Approve & Print:** Once you approve the quote and make a payment, we'll start printing your design!</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="note">For custom designs, we'll work closely with you through the design process to ensure your vision is accurately captured before printing.</p>
